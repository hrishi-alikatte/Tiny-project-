# 🎓 University Student & Professor Management System in C

## 📌 Project Description

This C program is a **University Management System** that allows you to manage students and professors in a structured academic environment. It uses **structures** (without typedef) and dynamic memory allocation (`malloc` and `calloc`) for flexible data handling.

The system supports core functionalities like adding, modifying, deleting, sorting, and searching student records, as well as assigning students to professors and managing supervised relationships.
